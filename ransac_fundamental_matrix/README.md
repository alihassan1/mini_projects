#  Project 5: Camera Calibration and Fundamental Matrix Estimation with RANSAC (
 assignment source: James Hays)

## Overview
This was one of my course assignments at Information Technology University (ITU), Lahore. In this assignment, I implemented 1) camera projection matrix, which maps 3D world coordinates to image coordinates 2) fundamental matrix, which relates points in one scene to epipolar lines in another. To estimate the projection matrix (camera calibration), the input is corresponding 3d and 2d points. To estimate the fundamental matrix the input is corresponding 2d points across two images, which are computer using VLFeatâ€™s implementation of SIFT.
